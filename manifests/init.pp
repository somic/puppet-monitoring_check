# == Define: monitoring_check
#
# A define for managing monitoring checks - wraps sensu::check giving
# less bolierplate and yelp specific runbook functionality.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*command*]
# The check command to run. This should be a standard nagios/sensu type check.
#
# [*runbook*]
# The URI to the google doc runbook for this check
# Should be of the form: y/my_runbook_name (preferred), or
# http://...some.uri. This is required.
#
# [*handlers*]
# An array of handlers to use for this check. Set to [] if this check should
# spawn no handlers. Defaults to ['default'], which uses standard Yelp
# sensu_handlers that are 'team'-aware.
#
# [*needs_sudo*]
# Boolean for if to run this check with sudo. Defaults to false
#
# [*sudo_user*]
# The user to sudo to (if needs_sudo is true). Defaults to root
#
# [*check_every*]
# How often to run this check. Can be an integer number of seconds, or an
# abbreviation such as '2m' for 120 seconds, or '2h' for 7200 seconds.
# Defaults to 1m.
#
# [*timeout*]
# How long the check will be allowed to run before it is killed and reported
# as failed. Defaults to the check_every frequency.
#
# [*alert_after*]
# How long a check is allowed to be failing for before alerting (pagerduty/slack).
# Can be an integer number of seconds, or an abbreviattion
# Defaults to 0s, meaning sensu will alert as soon as the check fails.
#
# [*realert_every*]
# Number of event occurrences before the handler should take action.
# For example, 10, would mean only re-notify every 10 fails.
# This logic only occurs after the alert_after time has expired.
# Defaults to -1 which means sensu will use exponential backoff.
#
# [*team*]
# The team responsible for this check (i.e. which team's pagerduty to escalate to)
# Defaults to operations, allowed to be any team in the hiera _sensu::teams_ key.
#
# [*page*]
# Boolean. If this alert should be escalated through to pagerduty.
# Every page also goes to a mandatory ${team}-pages, and is not configurable.
# Defaults to false.
#
# [*slack_channels*]
# Array of Slack channels to send notfications to. Set this to multiple channels
# if other teams are interested in your notifications. Set to [] if you need
# no Slack notifcations. (like, motd only or page only)
# Defaults to nil, which uses ${team}-notifications default from the Slack handler.
#
# [*notification_email*]
# A string for the mailto for emails for alerts. (paging and non-paging)
# Defaults to undef, which makes the handler use the global team default.
# Use false if you want the alert to never send emails.
# It *can* take a comma separated list as an argument like a normal email mailto.
#
# [*ticket*]
# Boolean. Determines if the JIRA handler is executed or not. Defaults to false.
#
# [*project*]
# Optionally set the JIRA project for a check. Otherwise if, if ticket=>true,
# then it will use the project set for the team.
#
# [*tip*]
# A quick tip for how to respond to / clear the alert without having to read the
# runbook. Optional (and custom checks are recommended to put the tip into the
# check output).
#
# [*sla*]
# Allows you to define the SLA for the service you are monitoring. Notice
# it is lower case!
#
# This is (currently) just a human readable string usable in handlers to give
# more context about the urgency of an alert when you see it in a
# ticket/page/email/slack.
#
# [*dependencies*]
# A list of dependencies for this check to be escalated if it's critical.
# If any of these dependencies are critical then the check will not be escalated
# by the handler.
#
# Dependencies are simply other check names, or certname/checkname for
# checks on other hosts.
# Defaults to empty
#
# [*use_sensu*]
# Implement the monitoring check with sensu. Defaults to true, and
# it's silly to set it to false until another monitoring system is supported.
#
# [*sensu_custom*]
# A hash of custom parameters to inject into the sensu check JSON output.
# These will override any parameters configured by the wrapper.
# Defaults to an empty hash.
#
# [*remediation_action*]
# Which script should run when a check fails?
#
# [*remediation_retries*]
# How many times should the script run before the check is marked as failed?
#
# [*low_flap_threshold*]
# Custom threshold at which to consider this service as having stopped flapping.
# Defaults to unset
# See http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/3_0/flapping.html for more details
#
# [*high_flap_threshold*]
# Custom threshold to consider this service flapping at
# Defaults to unset
#
# [*can_override*]
# A boolean that defaults to true for if the $::override_sensu_checks_to
# fact can be used to override the team (to 'noop') and the notification_email
# parameter (to the value of $::override_sensu_checks_to).
# Defaults to true.
#
# [*source*]
# String that identifies the source of this event or an entity (such as
# cluster, environment, datacenter, etc) to which it belongs.
# Should not be tied to a host that generated
# this event because it can come from any host where this check is deployed.
#
# [*tags*]
# An array of arbitrary tags that can be used in handlers for different metadata needs
# such as labels in JIRA handlers. This is optional and is empty by default
#
# [*subdue*]
# A hash the determines if and when a check should be silenced for a peroid of time,
# such as within working hours.
#
# [*description*]
# String that gives more context on this check. This could include information on what
# the check means or why was it created. This is optional.
#
# [*component*]
# A list of component(s) affected by this check. This could include the service that is
# affected or a module of that service such as healthcheck.
#
# This, by default allows you to set the $::override_sensu_checks_to fact
# in /etc/facter/facts.d to stop checks on a single machine from alerting via the
# normal mechanism. Setting this to false will stop this mechanism from applying
# to a check.
